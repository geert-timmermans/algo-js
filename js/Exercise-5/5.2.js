/* Create a function named randomizeCast(tvSerie) that will take as argument the data structure you defined in the 
previous exercise and return a list of the same cast but in a random order.

Create a program that will use randomizeCast(tvSerie) and askTvSerie() to ask the user about a TV serie then 
display a randomized list of the previous cast that will form the new cast of your next serie. */
